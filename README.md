# Networks-Lab-2b
Playing around with small, local Python web servers.

Exercise 1: Meant to demonstrate some differences in implementing UDP and TCP architecture. The client sends a sentence in lowercase to the server, which capitalizes it and sends it back.

Exercise 2: Use a slightly larger Python web server to display an HTML file. It focuses a bit more on correctly setting up ports and sockets.
